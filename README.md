Housing types and transportation are very crucial indices for social vulnerability all over the world. It is therefore necessary to evaluate and re-evaluate from time to time as it is a pointer to emergency preparedness.
Hazardous events have been in existence from time immemorial especially if it is natural like a tornado, disease outbreak, anthropogenic event and so on thus a need for a community, government, organization, and individuals to prepare and respond when it occurs. 
Iowa state over the last one decade has been experiencing rapid growth in its population in their major cities and its environs that will put a lot of pressure on the existing infrastructures especially housing and transportation that could have negative impact on the environment if not properly checked.
The use of web mapping, data visualization, and literature review, on this project will evaluate the social vulnerability index of state of Iowa from2014 to 2018 using housing types and transportation.
